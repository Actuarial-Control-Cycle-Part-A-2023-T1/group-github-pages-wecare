<h2 align="left">Executive Summary</h2>

WeCare has been hired to design a social insurance program for Storslysia with the ultimate goal of managing its exposure to displacement risk arising from catastrophic climate related events. WeCare is proposing a three-pronged approach:

- Providing property coverage for those affected by natural catastrophes
- Temporary accommodation and payments to cover displacement living costs
- Monetary grant incentives to promote proactive relocation to lower risk areas

Participation in this program will be compulsory and consists of individualised risk pricing for the six main regions of Storslysia. Catastrophes frequency and severity were projected to provide a measure of property damage for all regions. WeCare is confident the proposed social insurance program will be sustainable over the projected 127-year timeframe with an annual review process to monitor and revise assumptions. This report provides a risk assessment and mitigation framework to support Storslysia to manage its exposure to catastrophic climate related events

<h2 align="left">Objectives</h2>

Increasing temperatures and rising sea levels have been experienced worldwide due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions (EPA, Climate Change Indicators: Oceans 2022). Around the world the frequency and intensity of natural catastrophes are growing at an alarming rate. For the residents of Storslysia, its diverse geography exposes them to a range of different catastrophic events. The impacts of climate change have elevated the population's risk of displacement and not having home insurance in this current environment is a cause for concern (iDMC, Displacement, disasters and climate change 2021). WeCareâ€™s objective is to design a social insurance program to protect Storslysian households against this displacement risk. Our proposal possesses similar features to home insurance, by compensating homeowners financially to repair/replace their home when damaged by an insured catastrophic event. The scheme aims to provide affordable mandatory home insurance, coverage of temporary housing and living costs and incentives to encourage proactive relocation to less risky regions to the residents of Storyslysia.

<h3 align="left">Key Metrics to Monitor</h3>
|Metric |Aim  |Reporting Frequency  |
|-------   |--- |---                 |
| Proportion of displacements| Reduce % of population displaced  |Bi-annually  |
| Property Damage            | Lower levels of property damage   | Annually    |

<h2 align="left">Design</h2>
WeCare proposes a 3-part insurance program targeted at reducing the impact of potential catastrophic events and relocation.

1. Home insurance cover for catastrophic events for all homeowners.
2. Temporary displacement insurance to cover the costs of temporary relocation due to extreme hazard events.
3. Monetary grant incentives for households to purchase property in the safest region in Storslysia.
