# Executive Summary

WeCare has been hired to design a social insurance program for Storslysia with the
ultimate goal of managing its exposure to displacement risk arising from catastrophic
climate related events. WeCare is proposing a three-pronged approach:
• Providing property coverage for those affected by natural catastrophes
• Temporary accommodation and payments to cover displacement living costs
• Monetary grant incentives to promote proactive relocation to lower risk areas
Participation in this program will be compulsory and consists of individualised risk
pricing for the six main regions of Storslysia. Catastrophes frequency and severity
were projected to provide a measure of property damage for all regions. WeCare is
confident the proposed social insurance program will be sustainable over the
projected 127-year timeframe with an annual review process to monitor and revise
assumptions. This report provides a risk assessment and mitigation framework to
support Storslysia to manage its exposure to catastrophic climate related events
